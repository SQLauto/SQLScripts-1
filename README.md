# SQLScripts

This repository is a collection of SQL Server scripts I use.  Many of these scripts have been pulled down off the internet from others.  I make no claim to ownership or authorship for all of these.  

Please use at your own risk.  And for pete's sake, please test any code you find on the internet before running on production!
